## What Al-Alamia is

Al-Alamia is a managed outsourcing platform designed to help businesses request digital services while giving administrators a structured way to manage projects, assign work, review submissions, and track freelancer activity.

Unlike a traditional freelance marketplace, clients do not directly select freelancers. Instead, the platform follows a centralized workflow in which administrators review requests, organize the required work, and assign tasks to eligible freelancers.

The goal is simple: make freelance service delivery more organized, manageable, and quality-focused.

| | |
|---|---|
| **3** | Main user groups: Admins, Clients, and Freelancers |
| **Managed** | Project and task assignment controlled by administrators |
| **End-to-end** | A structured workflow from project request to work review |

## The Problem

Delivering digital services involves more than finding someone who can do the work. Projects also require coordination, clear requirements, deadline management, progress tracking, and quality assurance.

When these activities are handled through disconnected tools and informal processes, it can become difficult to keep everyone aligned.

Al-Alamia is designed around three key challenges:

- **Coordination:** Keeping project requests, requirements, and communication organized.
- **Accountability:** Tracking task ownership, deadlines, submissions, and revisions.
- **Quality control:** Providing a consistent review process before completed work is approved.

These challenges define the problem the platform aims to address.

## Our Approach

Al-Alamia brings project coordination and freelance task management into one managed workflow.

- **Centralized project management:** Clients submit service requests through the platform.
- **Admin-controlled assignment:** Administrators review projects, determine pricing, create tasks, and offer them to eligible freelancers.
- **Structured delivery:** Freelancers receive task requirements and submit completed work for review.
- **Quality assurance:** Administrators approve submissions or request revisions.
- **Financial tracking:** Freelancer earnings and deductions are recorded through a ledger.

The key difference is that Al-Alamia does not simply connect clients with freelancers. It manages the process through which work is assigned, completed, reviewed, and delivered.

## How It Works

The platform follows a defined service delivery lifecycle.

```text

  |              v
  |         Admin Review
  |
  +------ Approve the Work
                 |
                 v
          Client Delivery
```

### The main participants

| Participant | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Client** | Submits project requests and provides the required details. |
| **Admin** | Reviews requests, determines prices, creates tasks, manages assignments, and reviews submissions. |
| **Freelancer** | Receives eligible task offers, completes assigned work, and submits deliverables. |

## Technology Stack

The planned technology stack is organized around a .NET backend, a relational database, and a React frontend.

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **C#** | Backend programming language |
| **ASP.NET Core Web API** | Exposes backend endpoints for frontend and application operations |
| **Entity Framework Core** | Object-relational mapping and database access |
| **ASP.NET Core Identity** | User management, authentication support, and role integration |
| **JWT** | Token-based authentication for API requests |
| **Microsoft SQL Server** | Relational database for application data |
| **React** | Frontend user interface |
| **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** | Web interface structure, styling, and browser-side behavior |
| **Git and GitHub** | Version control and collaborative development |
| **Postman** | API testing |
| **Swagger / OpenAPI** | API documentation and exploration |

Technology implementation status may vary during development. Update this section to distinguish completed components from those still in progress.

## System Architecture

Al-Alamia is being designed as a layered application, separating business rules from infrastructure and presentation concerns.

The intended responsibilities are:

- **Domain:** Core entities and business concepts.
- **Application:** Business operations, service contracts, and use-case logic.
- **Infrastructure:** Database access and external infrastructure implementations.
- **API:** HTTP endpoints, request handling, authentication configuration, and dependency registration.
- **Frontend:** React pages and components that communicate with the backend API.

A conceptual dependency view:

```text
React Frontend
      |
      v
ASP.NET Core Web API
      |
      v
Application Services
      |
      v
Domain and Business Rules
      ^
      |
Infrastructure Implementations
      |
      v
SQL Server
```

The final project structure and dependency directions should match the architecture actually implemented in the repository.

## Data Model

The database is designed to support the complete managed outsourcing workflow, from user registration to project delivery and financial tracking.

| Area | Main entities |
|---|---|
| **Identity and Profiles** | ApplicationUser, ClientProfile, FreelancerProfile |
| **Tracks and Skills** | Track, Skill, TrackSkill, FreelancerSkill |
| **Portfolio** | PortfolioItem, PortfolioItemFile |
| **Services and Projects** | Service, Project, ProjectService, ProjectStatusHistory |
| **Meetings** | Meeting |
| **Tasks and Assignment** | Task, TaskRequiredSkill, TaskOffer, TaskStatusHistory, TaskReassignment, TaskFile |
| **Submissions and Reviews** | TaskSubmission, TaskReview, TaskRevision, SubmissionFile |
| **Financial Records** | FreelancerLedgerEntry, FreelancerBlock |
| **Marketing Packages** | MarketingPackage, MarketingPackageItem, ProjectMarketingPackage, ProjectMarketingPackageItem |
| **Files and Support** | File, ProjectFile, SupportTicket, SupportMessage, SupportMessageFile |
| **Notifications** | Notification, EmailNotificationLog |

The final entity list should be synchronized with the actual database model and migrations.

### Important data relationships

- A client can create multiple projects.
- A project can request multiple predefined services.
- A freelancer belongs to a track and can have multiple skills.
- A task belongs to a track and may require specific skills.
- A task can receive offers from eligible freelancers, but only one freelancer should successfully claim it.
- A task can have multiple submissions and review or revision records over its lifecycle.
- A published portfolio item must have exactly three images.
- Financial ledger entries provide a traceable record of freelancer earnings and deductions.

## Security and Access Control

The platform uses ASP.NET Core Identity and JWT as part of its planned authentication and authorization approach.

Security responsibilities include:

- **Identity management:** Managing user accounts and authentication-related information.
- **Role-based authorization:** Restricting operations according to the user's role and permissions.
- **Client ownership:** Ensuring clients can access only their own projects and related information.
- **Freelancer access:** Restricting task operations to the appropriate freelancer and assignment state.
- **Administrative operations:** Protecting privileged actions such as task assignment, reviews, and account management.
- **Input validation:** Validating incoming requests before business operations are performed.

Authentication alone is not sufficient: authorization must also verify that the authenticated user is allowed to perform the requested action on the specific resource.

## Task Assignment and Review

Task assignment and review are central parts of Al-Alamia's workflow.

### 1. Eligibility

Task offers are sent to freelancers who meet the platform's eligibility requirements, including the relevant track and approval status.

### 2. First valid acceptance

Multiple freelancers may receive an offer, but the system must ensure that only the first valid acceptance successfully claims the task. This requires consistent handling of concurrent requests.

### 3. Submission and review

The assigned freelancer submits the completed work. The administrator reviews it and can approve the submission or request revisions.

### 4. Reassignment and accountability

When a task cannot proceed with its current assignment, the platform records the relevant status changes and reassignment history.

### 5. Financial records

Applicable earnings and deductions are recorded with their associated reasons and tasks, allowing the platform to maintain an auditable financial history.

The purpose of these rules is to make task ownership, work quality, and responsibility traceable throughout the process.

## Challenges and Engineering Decisions

### Designing a connected data model

The platform contains several related business areas: identity, projects, freelancer skills, tasks, submissions, support, and financial records.

**Engineering focus:** Define clear entity relationships and preserve referential integrity without introducing unnecessary duplication.

### Handling concurrent task acceptance

More than one freelancer may try to accept the same task at nearly the same time.

**Engineering focus:** Enforce a single successful assignment using appropriate database constraints and transaction-safe application logic.

### Managing task lifecycle transitions

Tasks can move through offers, assignment, submission, review, revision, approval, and possible reassignment.

**Engineering focus:** Define valid status transitions and preserve the history of important changes.

### Protecting resources and operations

Different users have different permissions, and access to a resource must depend on both the user's role and ownership or assignment.

**Engineering focus:** Combine authentication with resource-level authorization and request validation.

### Maintaining financial traceability

Penalties and earnings must remain associated with the correct task and reason.

**Engineering focus:** Record financial changes consistently and avoid applying the same applicable penalty twice to one task.

### Integrating frontend and backend

The React application must communicate reliably with the API while handling authentication, validation, loading states, and errors.

**Engineering focus:** Establish consistent API contracts and predictable response handling.
